# Git-Subset-Implementation
UNSW COMP2041 2021 Assignment 1

INTRODUCTION:
Your task in this assignment is to implement Girt, a subset of the version control system Git. Git is a very complex program which has many individual commands. You will implement
only a few of the most important commands. You will also be given a number of simplifying assumptions, which make your task easier. Girt is a contraction of git restricted subset
You must implement Girt in Shell. Interestingly, early versions of Git made heavy use of Shell and Perl.

REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION:
Many aspects of this assignment are not fully specified in this document; instead, you must match the behaviour of a reference implementation. For example, your script girt-add
should match the behaviour of 2041 girt-add exactly, including producing the same error messages. Provision of a reference implementation is a common method to provide or define
an operational specification, and it's something you will likely need to do after you leave UNSW. Discovering and matching the reference implementation's behaviour is deliberately
part of the assignment. While the code in the reference implementation is fairly straight forward, reverse-engineering its behaviour is obviously not so simple, and is a nice
example of how coming to grips with the precise semantics of an apparently obvious task can still be challenging.
